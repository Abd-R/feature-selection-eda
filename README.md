# EDA for Feature Selection

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for feature selection using Python's matplotlib library. The goal is to analyze the dataset's features through univariate and bivariate analysis techniques to understand their distributions, relationships, and importance for subsequent feature selection processes.

## Frameworks

- Matplotlib

## Data Analysis Techniques

1. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Analyzing individual features in isolation to understand their distributions and characteristics.
   - Techniques used: Histograms, Box plots, Count plots, etc.

2. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Analyzing the relationships between pairs of features to identify patterns, correlations, and dependencies.
   - Techniques used: Scatter plots, Pair plots, Heatmaps, etc.
